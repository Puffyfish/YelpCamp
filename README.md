# YelpCamp
This repository contains the code following Colt Steele's YelpCamp project, which is part of his Web Developer Bootcamp course on Udemy.

## Project Overview
YelpCamp is a full-stack web application that allows users to view, create, and review campgrounds. Users can create an account, add campgrounds with images, edit and delete their campgrounds, and leave reviews for other users' campgrounds. The app also includes user authentication and authorization using Passport.js, as well as integration with the Mapbox API for displaying campground locations on a map.

## What You'll Learn
* How to create a RESTful web application using Node.js and Express
* How to work with MongoDB and Mongoose to store and retrieve data
* How to implement user authentication and authorization using Passport.js
* How to integrate with third-party APIs like Mapbox
* How to deploy a web application to Heroku

## Getting Started
* To get started with the project, you can clone this repository to your local machine.
* Run 'npm install' to your terminal to install the required dependencies and run the application.
* CD to seeds folder.
* node index.js - to run seeder to get dummy data 
* CD to main folder and run 'nodemon app.js' - to run app to a browser

*** You will need to set up a free Mapbox account to obtain an API key, and a MongoDB database to store your application data.

## Conclusion
YelpCamp is a really great project. I was able to learn how to create a full-stack web application using Node.js, Express. I was also able to get a lot of practice using MongoDB.
